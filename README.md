## Overview

This project is built on the ideas in the original video service to add OAuth 2.0
authentication of clients and the ability to "like" videos.

Service allows users to authenticate using the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.
Once authenticated, users must be able to like/unlike videos, as well as search for videos
by name and duration. In addition, video data is stored in a Spring Data JPA repository.
